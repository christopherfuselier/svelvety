		<p>Whan that Aprill with his shoures soote
			The droghte of March hath perced to the roote,
			And bathed every veyne in switch licour
			Of which vertu engendred is the flour;
			Whan Zephirus eek with his sweete breeth
			Inspired hath in every holt and heeth
			The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne
			Hath in the Ram his half cours yronne,
			And smale foweles maken melodye,
			That slepen al the nyght with open ye
			(So Priketh hem Nature in hir corages),
			Thanne longen folk to goon on pilgrimages,
			And palmeres for to seken straunge strondes,
			To ferne halwes, kowthe in sondry londes;
			And specially from every shires ende
			Of Engelond to Caunterbury they wende,
			The hooly blisful martir for to seke,
			That hem hath holpen whan that they were seeke.</p>
